Sites without machine-readable surfaces serve agents HTML soup, so they go uncited and agents can't operate them. agentready measures that gap with 15 checks. It ships as one file with zero dependencies and needs no API keys, accounts or cloud.

## What it guarantees

- **Evidence for every verdict.** Each check records the URL it requested and the status it got back, and the report prints both.
- **Soft-404s fail.** A file check passes only when the response is OK, the body does not start as an HTML page, it differs from what a random nonexistent path on the same site returns, and it is valid for its type (`llms.txt`: over 40 bytes).
- **Reproducible score.** The score is `earned / 93` weighted points, rounded. Grades run A ≥ 90, B ≥ 78, C ≥ 62, D ≥ 45, E ≥ 25, F otherwise.
- **No supply chain.** No `node_modules` and no lockfile. It uses Node's global `fetch` only.
- **Read-only.** The scanner only issues GET requests and writes nothing to the target.

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/marsojuji-cmyk/agentready && cd agentready
node scan.mjs stripe.com
```

Sample output (recorded when this README was first written):

```
  AI AGENT READINESS — stripe.com
  ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  SCORE 47/100   GRADE D   (44/93 weighted points)
  ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  PASS   4pt  Served over HTTPS
  PASS  12pt  llms.txt present          → 200 (69878 bytes)
  FAIL   4pt  llms-full.txt present     → 404
  FAIL  10pt  robots.txt addresses AI crawlers

  TOP FIXES:
   1. llms-full.txt present          (+4 pts available)
   2. robots.txt addresses AI crawlers (+10 pts available)
   3. Agent/MCP manifest present      (+8 pts available)
```

The scan writes a standalone HTML report and a JSON record to `./agentready-out/`. Pass `--out <dir>` to change the location or `--json` for machine-readable output.

## How it fails

| Condition | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| A request errors or exceeds the timeout | Each request is time-bounded (12 s by default, `--timeout <ms>` to change). It records status `0` and the check fails, but the scan does not crash |
| Site unreachable (DNS, TLS or connect error on both HTTPS and HTTP) | Reported as `UNREACHABLE` with the error, exit code `2`, and **no score** |
| Catch-all site (any unknown path returns `200`) | The scanner first requests a random path that cannot exist. A file whose body matches that page, or HTML served for a `.txt`/`.json`/`.xml` path, is reported as `soft-404` and fails |
| Malformed JSON-LD block | The scanner skips that block and counts only parseable types |
| Issue bot: no URL in the issue | Replies asking for a URL and scans nothing |
| Issue bot: `localhost`, `*.local`, `*.internal`, IP literals, non-http(s) | Rejects the target and explains why. The filter checks hostnames only and does not resolve DNS, so it is hygiene, not a full SSRF defence |
| Issue bot: scan fails or times out | Replies that the site refused the request or timed out |

## Try it without installing anything

Open an issue titled **"Scan my site"** with a URL in the body —
[**click here**](https://github.com/marsojuji-cmyk/agentready/issues/new?title=Scan%20my%20site&body=My%20website%20is%3A%20https%3A%2F%2F)
— and a GitHub Action scans the site and posts the full report as a comment.
No backend, no signup, no API key. See a live one:
[issue #1](https://github.com/marsojuji-cmyk/agentready/issues/1).

## Usage

```bash
# single site → HTML report + JSON
node scan.mjs example.com --out ./out

# machine-readable
node scan.mjs example.com --json

# show only the 5 biggest fixes (default: every failing check); per-request timeout in ms
node scan.mjs example.com --top 5 --timeout 8000

# a cohort → ranked leaderboard + CSV
node batch.mjs my-list.txt --out ./out --cat "Calgary plumbers"
node batch.mjs my-list.txt --out ./out --anon   # leaderboard shows Site A, Site B, … instead of hosts

# the fix, not the diagnosis → tailored llms.txt + robots AI block + schema + instructions
node fix.mjs example.com --out ./fixes
node fix.mjs jane-doe.dev --out ./fixes --type person   # auto-detected by default: person | organization | localbusiness

# regression tests (zero dependencies, local fake servers)
node --test test/
```

Exit codes: `0` scanned, `1` usage error, `2` site unreachable. An unreachable site is reported as
`UNREACHABLE` with the DNS/TLS/connect error and is **not** given a score.

Every file check is soft-404 aware: the scanner first requests a random path that cannot exist. If the
site answers it with `200` (a catch-all, e.g. an SPA host with no 404 page), any file whose body matches
that page, or any HTML body served for a `.txt`/`.json`/`.xml` path, is reported as `soft-404` and fails.

## What it checks: 15 signals, 93 weighted points

| Weight | Check |
|---|---|
| 12 | `llms.txt` present (real content, not a soft-404) |
| 12 | JSON-LD structured data |
| 10 | robots.txt has an explicit `User-agent` group for at least one AI crawler (GPTBot, ClaudeBot, PerplexityBot, Google-Extended, …). Allow **or** Disallow counts; evidence lists which are allowed and which are blocked; comment-only mentions do not count |
| 8 | OpenAPI / Swagger spec discoverable |
| 8 | Agent manifest (`/.well-known/mcp.json`, `ai-plugin.json`, …) |
| 8 | Markdown content negotiation (`Accept: text/markdown`) |
| 5 | `sitemap.xml` reachable |
| 5 | High-value schema types (Organization, LocalBusiness, Product, FAQPage, Article, Person, ProfilePage, SoftwareSourceCode, …) |
| 5 | OpenGraph + meta description |
| 4 | HTTPS (a real TLS connection), `llms-full.txt` |
| 3 | `ai.txt`, `security.txt`, agent hint files, sitemap declared in robots.txt (a robots.txt with only a `Sitemap:` record is a valid file under RFC 9309: it earns this point, but not the AI-crawler points) |

The table mirrors the `add(...)` calls in `scan.mjs`, which sum to 93. The weights are opinionated and public: edit them in `scan.mjs` and argue with them.

## Evidence

- **Committed cohort scan:** [`examples/agent-readiness-2026-10-06.html`](examples/agent-readiness-2026-10-06.html) ([CSV](examples/agent-readiness-2026-10-06.csv)), 20 sites anonymized as Site A–T. 0 of 20 sites grade C or better, the best score is 49/100, and 6 of 20 could not be read by the scanner. Full figures under [Why it matters](#why-it-matters).
- **Live issue scan:** [issue #1](https://github.com/marsojuji-cmyk/agentready/issues/1).
- **Quickstart output:** the `stripe.com` sample above, re-run on 2026-10-07. It scored 47/100, grade D, 44/93 points. Live sites change, so your numbers may differ.
- Regression tests: `node --test test/` (zero dependencies, local fake servers). CodeQL code scanning and the scan-on-issue workflow run on GitHub Actions.

## Why it matters

Agents — ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini, Copilot — increasingly read sites through
machine-readable surfaces *before* they read the HTML. `llms.txt`, AI crawler rules in
`robots.txt`, `schema.org` JSON-LD, an OpenAPI spec, an MCP manifest, markdown content
negotiation. When a site lacks them, the agent gets an HTML soup of nav links and marketing
copy, or nothing at all.

Two things happen then: the site **doesn't get cited** when someone asks an assistant a
question it should have answered, and it **can't be operated** by an agent that wanted to
book, quote, or buy.

On **2026-10-06** we scanned the websites of 20 Calgary-area plumbing, heating and HVAC
companies with this version of the scanner (one pass of `node batch.mjs <list> --anon`,
user-agent `AgentReadyBot/1.0`, soft-404 aware). Full leaderboard:
[`examples/agent-readiness-2026-10-06.html`](examples/agent-readiness-2026-10-06.html) (sites anonymized as Site A–T).

| | |
|---|---|
| Sites graded C (62+) or better | **0 of 20** |
| Best score | **49 / 100** (grade D; five sites tied) |
| Mean score | **25.9 / 100** across the 19 sites that answered (33.8 across the 14 the scanner could read) |
| Sites publishing `llms.txt` | 5 of 20 |
| Sites with JSON-LD | 10 of 20 |
| Could not be read by the scanner | **6 of 20**: 3 bot walls (403 / CAPTCHA), 2 domains with no site connected, 1 redirect loop (unreachable, not scored) |

The 6 unreadable sites stay in the counts. The 5 that answered are scored on what an agent actually
received (4/100, HTTPS only): that is the honest answer for an agent, but it says nothing about the
content behind the wall. A different network or user-agent may get through.

Three of the five that publish `llms.txt` do so by accident: Yoast SEO (v28.5 / v28.6) and Rank Math
now auto-generate it.

These figures replace an earlier 2026-10-04 run (mean 22.7). That run used a scanner that counted
bot-challenge pages as real files and scored a domain it could not reach; both bugs are fixed here.
Scores also move day to day: one site that blocked the scanner on Oct 4 scored 49 on Oct 6.

## Design constraints

- **Zero dependencies.** No `node_modules`, no lockfile, no supply chain. Global `fetch` only.
- **One file, readable in a sitting.** You can audit every claim it makes about your site.
- **Evidence, not vibes.** Every check prints the URL it hit and the status it got back.
- **Soft-404 aware.** A 200 that returns HTML is not a passing `llms.txt`.

## Status

Working tool, early. The single-site scanner and the issue bot run in production on this repo. The weights are opinionated and open to argument.
